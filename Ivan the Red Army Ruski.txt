You know Stalin and Yeltsin and Putin and Dixon
Mendeleev and then Richard Nixon
But do you recall
The greatest Ruski of them all?

Ivan the Red Army Ruski (Ruski)
Had a very large rifle (Kalashnikov)
And if you ever saw it (Saw it)
Idea 1:
You wouldn’t live to see the day (Like Osama)
Idea 2:
You would blow your arm right off (Like Osama)

All of the other Ruskis (Ruskis)
Used to laugh and call him names (Cyka pidar)
Well I guess the joke’s on them now (Them now)
Cuz Ivan shot those bums dead (Like Osama)

Then one average Russian night
Stalin came to say (Cy - Ka - Blyat)
“Ivan, with your gun so large
Won’t you attack the US?” (Like Osama)

Then how the US hates him (Hates him)
As the shout in agony (Yippee)
“Ivan the Red Army Ruski (Ruski)
You’ll be shot by the marines!” (Like Osama)
